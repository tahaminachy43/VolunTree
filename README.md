**Voluntree allows users to easily access volunteering opportunities posted by organizations.**

The app is organized into **3 main folders**:

InitialPages - SignIn/Register/Preferences views
OrganizationPages
UserPages

The initial view to start the app is at InitialPages/Starter. 
Users can register/login while organizations can only sign in.

**Dummy organization login data:**
email: saviturmaharaj@gmail.com
password: password

**App flow:**
1. Org posts volunteering opportunity - implemented and can be done by clicking **+** on the initial org profile page.
2. User can request to join the volunteering opportunity - implemented on the user search view by clicking on a volunteering card.
3. Org can approve/reject the "pending" request - implemented but XCode sometimes gives problems when view application is clicked (**TO DO**: resolve this issue)
4. User can request to complete a volunteering opportunity - **TO DO**
5. Org can confirm user's request to complete the opportunity - **TO DO**
6. User can request a recommendation letter - **TO DO**
7. Org can write recommendation letter - **TO DO: implement functionality, implement AI generated letters based on prompts**

**General TO DOs:**
1. Implement functionality on map view
2. Implement chat feature
3. Make changes to Challenges view
4. Implement complete functionality for user profile
5. Incorporate app logo throughout the app
6. Move away from Firebase to a custom backend to avoid scaling costs (huge endeavor and should be implemented before the app gets too big).
